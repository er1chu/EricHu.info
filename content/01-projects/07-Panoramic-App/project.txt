Title: Panoramic Landscapes iPad App
----
Text: iPad application that takes advantage of the device's built-in accelerometer. In order to view a video of someone walking in first-person perspective, the user has to actually be walking. If the user stops moving, the video also stops playing. In essence, in order to experience a video of traveling through a city block, you have to actually walk the length of the city block. This was an attempt to introduce physical dimensions into a time-based medium. For a workshop with Karel Martens. Extended video coming soon.
